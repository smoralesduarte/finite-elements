# finite-elements

Implementation of a powerful ﬁnite element method for ﬁnding numerical
approximations to the solutions to boundary value problems involving both ordinary and
partial diﬀerential equations can be solved by direct integration. The method relies on the
characterization of the solution as the minimizer of a suitable quadratic functional.
